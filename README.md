## Introduction

The Shop Simulation project is a Java-based simulation of a shop environment where customers can enter, place orders, be served by servers, pay for their orders, and leave the shop. This simulation is designed to illustrate multi-threading and concurrent programming concepts.

## Features

- Customers can enter the shop, place orders, and pay.
- Servers are available to serve customers by making products.
- Simulated customers and servers interact concurrently.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the simulation, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shop-simulation.git
   cd shop-simulation
   ```

2. Compile the Java code:

   ```bash
   javac src/com/apophis/shop/*.java
   ```

## Usage

### Customizing Simulation

You can customize the simulation by adjusting the parameters in the `ShopSimulation` class:

```java
// Number of customers to simulate
int numCustomers = 10;

// Number of servers available
int numServers = 4;
```

### Running the Simulation

1. Run the simulation:

   ```bash
   java -cp src com.apophis.shop.ShopSimulation
   ```
